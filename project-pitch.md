### Exploring Global Infertility v. Fertility Trends

I will use World Bank data on birth rates, a systematic review on global infertility rates, and link them to other international datasets to explore potential causes and consequences of infertility, and how these vary by region.


I wish to address these questions in the forms of data visualizations:
- The correlation between rates of fertility and infertility on a global scale (scatterplot)
- This same information broken down further by primary v. secondary fertility
- Regional comparisons of fertility and infertility rates, with a spotlight on countries that may have seen large reductions in infertilty prevalence since 1990 (map, line graph)
- The correlation between rates of STDs and infertility (scatterplot)
- The correlation between age at first birth and infertility
(scatterplot)
- The ratio of cases of infertilty attributed to males v. females v. both partners (stacked bar charts or pie charts)
