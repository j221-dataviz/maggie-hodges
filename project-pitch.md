### Exploring Global Infertility v. Fertility Trends

I will use World Bank data on birth rates, a systematic review on global infertility rates, and link them to other international datasets to explore potential causes and consequences of infertility, and how these vary by region.


I wish to address these questions in the forms of data visualizations:
- The correlation between rates of fertility and infertility on a global scale (scatterplot)
- This same information broken down further by primary v. secondary fertility
- Regional comparisons of fertility and infertility rates, with a spotlight on countries that may have seen large reductions in infertilty prevalence since 1990 (map, bar graph)
- The correlation between rates of STDs and infertility (scatterplot)
- The correlation between age at first birth and infertility
(scatterplot)
- The ratio of cases of infertilty attributed to males v. females v. both partners (stacked bar charts or pie charts)

####What I have done:
-Sourced and downloaded several datasets related to my topic
-Used R to clean, organize and manipulate these files
-Used Tableau to prototype visualizations and detect where there are interesting relationships to show

###What I intend to do:
-Finalize the 6 or so visualizations I want to show (using Tableau to prototype)by completing necessary cleaning & manipualation
-I have about 3 of the 6 visualizations ready (data organized
properly for visualization) 
-Create these visualizations in R 
-Write accompanying text that provides the context needed for
these trends

###Problems/obstacles:
-I need to further explore potential data that shows hypothesized causes of infertility and compares these factors across countries/regions
-This includes further cleaning and merging some data I already have, and also potentially downloading new data
-Unfortunately, when I tried to visualize average age at first birth in a counry in relation to infertility rates, it did not show a positive correlation (as we thought it might, given that women choosing to have children later have a more difficult time).
-It actually showed a negative correlation, so as average age of first birth decreases rates of infertility decline. This makes me think this relationship is confounded by other factors, in that countries where age of first birth is very young tend to have poor reproductive health care overall which may result in higher infertility rates, even though age itself
is a big factor in infertility
-Still need to prototype a visual of STI prevalance in relation
to infertility prevalence
-Another issue I'm having is merging datasets that have different years and countries present, or ones that are organized only by region or only by country, and not by both. I need help thinking through how I can work with what I have even though it may mean soem visualzations are working with different information (i.e. not all visualizaitons will have information for all countries across the same years, may need to take a regional approach on some variables). When I
started I thought I would be able to pull more variables from
the world bank so it would be easy to merge, but it turned out that I didn't have the other factors I was looking at in relation to infertility.
-Data on male infertility is really patchy and not reliable because of underreporting, but I want to figure out a basic and relatively accurate way to demonstrate that about a third of the cases of infertility are attributable to a female, another third a male, and another third some combination of both
